Main challenges are:

- determining when there is a 'breaking story', perhaps from some breaking news twitter feed?
- given all the articles teasers on a publisher's homepage, which is the best candidate for this 'breaking story'?
- best way to display these on twitter - Twitter allows up to 4 images in one tweet.
