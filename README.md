# Run for latest BBC breaking news story

`docker-compose up`


### Format code

`docker-compose run wtps black`


# Challenges

- determining when there is a 'breaking story', perhaps from some breaking news twitter feed?
- given all the articles teasers on a publisher's homepage, which is the best candidate for this 'breaking story'?
- best way to display these on twitter - Twitter allows up to 4 images in one tweet.


# Todo

- add more publishers
- run on Heroku
- create twitter account
- collate results for each story into at most 4 images
- publish tweet on schedule or trigger
